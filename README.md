# I have completed an enhanced version of the classic snake game 🐍 using java and java swing.
key functionalities:
1.The Snake will have the ability to move in all four 
directions. 
2.The snake’s length grows as it eats food. When 
the snake crosses itself or strikes the perimeter of 
the box, 
3.the game is marked over. 
4.Food is always given at different positions.

Building this game allowed me to dive deep learning into the OOPS principles and designing a flexible code structure. The java swing library facilitated smooth graphics and interactive elements which resulting in a visual appealing and engaging user experience.
